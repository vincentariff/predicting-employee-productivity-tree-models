## Introduction

* In this project we'll be predicting employee productivity using Classification Decision Tree and Random Forest Modeling in Python.

* We explored and cleaned the data, applied feature engineering with one-hot encoding, visualized and evaluated a decision tree model, optimized it using GridSearchCV, validated performance with cross-validation, and implemented a random forest model for improved accuracy.

*  We found that if we have a specific plan and number for each team for incentive, smv (the allocated time for a task), and number of workers, we can predict up to 84% on whether that team will be productive or not.

## Dataset

* The dataset _Productivity Prediction of Garment Employees_ we are using comes from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/597/productivity+prediction+of+garment+employees).
* The dataset can be found in `garments_worker_productivity.csv` file.
